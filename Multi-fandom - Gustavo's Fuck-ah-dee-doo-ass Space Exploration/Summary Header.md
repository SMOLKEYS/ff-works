"So... your definition of 'Space Exploration' is 'Fly to fuckall somewhere, crash into... well, something on some random universe, relax there for anywhere between 5 minutes to a whole month while you and Sym fix the broken rocket, then leave and repeat', am I correct?" Ivy asks.

"Correct!" Gustavo exclaims. "Our findings in each universe will also make for a WWWONDERFUL document as well!"

"...I will fucking kill you once we get back home. Also, Sym, why did you and the others agree?"

"Uh... somethin' new to do, I guess."

To our unfortunate victims... I am so sorry.
