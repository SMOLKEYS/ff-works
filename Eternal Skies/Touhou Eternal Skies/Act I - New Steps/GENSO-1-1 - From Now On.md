The surroundings decay into particles, consumed by waves of pure entropy.

"...hey."

"Yeah?"

"Do you wish we could've done better for this world?"

"...I do. I really do."

"..."

"Right now, though, we need to go."

"I guess so.

...

You think we'll end up in the same world?"

"...I hope, but, given how this works... probably not."

"Well, hope you're prepared to go solo."

"Heh, fuck you, I'm always prepared.

...you ready?"

"...yeah."

...

And so, they jumped down, falling into the resonating portal.

"...see you on the other side, Viper."

"...same to you, Proto."

[POV: Viper]

As we both fell into the portal, the dissolving world behind us quickly followed, with a violent roar. Closing my eyes, I brace for what's coming next...

...

*SNAP!*

A loud snap.

Then, silence.

Opening my eyes, I'm met with... darkness, as if I never opened them in the first place.

"*...did it not work?*"

Glancing down at my body, it's... fully visible. As it was.

I can see myself, but the surroundings seem to act like an infinite void, absorbing all light.

"I don't necessarily fear never-ending open spaces, but this is still a bit terrifying..."

...

"...Proto?"

I try calling out to Proto.

No response.

"Damn it."

Unfortunately, Proto was right.

And him being right means we're completely on our own paths now.

...shit.

"*I did say that, but this is gonna take some time to get used to.*"

"*...hopefully he's fine, wherever he got taken to.*"

...now to address the elephant in the room. Or, well, lack thereof:

I'm still in the middle of absolutely god-knows-where.

"*...please tell me I'm not stuck here.*"

...

"Oh?"

Looking around, it's all void. I'm floating in... nothing, but at the distance, I can see something.

"Too far away for me to make something out... hm, can I...?"

Moving my arms and legs, I make a diving motion, and surprisingly enough-

"-it works!"

"*Okay, so I can dive around like I'm underwater here...*"

Noting that, I begin to make my way to the distant object.

...

.....

"The hell is this...?"

Floating close enough that I can now see it clearly, I take a look on what it is. Safe to say: Certainly a portal of sorts.

...can't forget to mention the, uh, *many* eyes within it staring outwards. Not at me, but might as well be me given how ominous this is.

"...well then!"

So, I have two options:

- Go into the ominous "eye portal", and hopefully get taken somewhere that isn't this place, and hopefully not somewhere that is basically instant death, assuming the portal itself doesn't just kill me.
- Or, wait here in the void for something else to appear and get me "out", which is probably not gonna happen,

...

...yeah, fuck the second option.

"*Well, here goes nothing, I guess...*"

Bracing myself again and closing my eyes, I motion my body into the portal.

...

"*...wonder if someone is setting me up here.*"
