[POV: Nahoko]

Well, I had initially gauged Marisa to be a curious one, as I've seen during our first encounter, but... man, I completely underestimated that curiosity.

As we made our way to the shrine, I got absolutely bombarded with questions on the way there. I managed to somehow keep up and answer them, up until...

"Say, how'd you even end up *here* in the first place?"

...that question.

I knew exactly how most of it went: Me and Proto escaped our world, we got separated, I went into some sort of "portal" with a... rather daunting amount of eyes, I fell unconscious, and suddenly... here I am. In Gensokyo.

I hesitated a bit on divulging that information, but realized that I don't really have... much to hide. So, I went ahead and... told her.

The situation with my world.

About Proto, who had basically been my partner-in-crime through the entire endeavor.

The escape portal that separated us.

And the thing that brought me here in the first place.

As I told her about almost everything, it felt like a weight was being lifted off my shoulders, but... at the same time, it also felt like I was mentally cracking.

Choosing to not get to that point, I hold back my emotions and continue. 

"*...probably not a good idea at all to do that, since everything can come crashing down on me at once, but... there's a better time to vent. And now is not that time.*"

Marisa noticed my distraught expression as I kept going, but chose to stay silent and let me speak.

...

.....

"And... that's where that ends. Here I am, somehow alive, in Gensokyo."

"..."

Once I finished, she stayed silent, seemingly shocked by my situation.

"Uh... Marisa?" I call out to her, hoping to break the awkward silence from the sudden mood shift.

"Oh, uh... sorry, I just, uh, wasn't expecting the answer to be so... heavy." She frowns. "Though, was that question a bit too... intrusive?" She asks nervously, somewhat worried that she might have poked into something too personal.

"Ah, no. It's fine." I answer, reassuring her. "In fact, being able to speak up like this made me feel a bit less... burdened, if I had to put it." I follow up truthfully.

"Okay, that's good." She sighs. "Well, hey, I'm glad to help ya feel better, even if it wasn't by a lot." Her smile seems to return, though now a more gentler one.

...

"?" She notices my curious gaze. Realizing what I was doing, I turn away in slight embarrassment.

"*...alright, Nahoko. Stop looking at her face.*" I muse to myself.

"Anyways... we're, uh, getting sidetracked again." I remind Marisa.

"O-oh, right! Let's keep moving!"

And off we went, again.

This time, though, our walk to the shrine had become more calmer, since she seemed to be content with the answers I gave her.

...

"Wait a minute-!"

Well, not for long, since she then quickly remembered to ask me about my magic, and my world's magic in general.

"*This might take a bit of explaining to do...*"

---

[Some time later...]

"Wait, hold on..." Marisa stops me mid-explanation, remembering something.

"What is it?"

"You said you were brought here by a 'portal with eyes', right?" She asks me.

"...yes?"

"Well, in that case... I might have a clue who brought you here, then." That immediately grabs my attention.

"Oh?"

"I'm not 100% sure yet, but given how she is a lot of the time... it doesn't seem too far off that she would bring someone like you here, then speak nothing of it until you actually meet her directly."

"...huh. What's her name?"

"Yakumo Yukari. Only the latter if you know her long enough, and former if you wanna talk formally with her. Assuming she took ya here, then what you just entered to get into Gensokyo is something she actively controls, called 'gaps'." She clarifies. So those things are called 'gaps', huh...

Hmm...

"Now I'm curious about one thing... why?" I ask, confused. "As far as I'm concerned, I'm no big shot, just a... well... to realistically put it: A remnant of a lost world."

"Honestly, I couldn't give ya an answer even if I wanted to, ze." She answers. "How do I put this... Yukari's the type of person to leave behind pieces of a puzzle, have you pick them up and finish it, only to reveal you just finished a single piece of an even bigger puzzle. She's one hell of a mystery, but everyone chooses to leave that be since she, well, not only is she one you *really* shouldn't try to pick a fight with, she also maintains the barrier that seperates Gensokyo from the Outside World."

...huh.

"To keep things simple: She's a mystery to everyone, and you'll only *probably* get an answer to your question from her directly. Well, assumin' ya don't get lead on, that is." Marisa concludes.

"Well then... that said both everything and nothing at the same time. Though, if I'm gonna be honest, I wanna thank her."

"Why's that?"

"Well, would you rather be floating away in a void of literally nothing, or would you prefer an actual world to live in?" I ask her rhetorically.

"...ah, makes sense." She realizes what I meant by that.

"...also, we're getting sidetracked again."

"Oh, right."

"*How do we sidetrack ourselves from another thing that already sidetracked us...?*"

---

[Even more time later...]

...good as done. That took far longer than what I expected, not including the conversation about Yukari, that is.

"So, the basic gist of it is that... there's 8 kinds of magic where you come from?" Marisa asks, reassessing what she heard from me.

"Correct."

"And those are... Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Electric, Kinetic, Light and Dark magic?"

"Yeah. My specialty is Light magic, but I *am* well-versed in Fire, Kinetic and Air magic too."

...well, I do also have *some* ideas on the other types, but I'd rather focus on the ones that I know I can safely use.

"And the first 4 I mentioned belongs in a set called the 'Elemental Set', while the last 4 belongs in one called the 'Unique Set'?"

"Mhm." I nod.

"I see... say, I have-"

"Nope." I cut her off. "Why don't we just... continue at the shrine, yes?" I suggest. I can already see it from here.

"Ah... yeah, sure."

As we make our way to the shrine, I can make out a few figures ahead of its Torii gate. The first one looks like a girl donning... red and white attire, from what I can see, the second girl seems to have long, green hair with a... horn(?) above her head, and a third girl with wings, a jester hat, and... is her clothing styled like the fucking American flag?

"*The hell...?*"

I still fully remember Marisa telling me that common sense here in Gensokyo might have a few screws loose compared to where I'm from, but, man... we're really starting off with a girl that could probably piss off most of America with her attire, huh?

As we get closer, the three girls notice us. They recognize Marisa, but not me, so their gazes become more curious. Once we're close enough, she goes on ahead to greet them.

"Yo, Reimu! Came by to visit again! Oh, and if ya don't mind, I brought someone interesting along with me on my way here." She greets Reimu, most likely the one in red-and-white, and then mentions me.

"...what did you get yourself into this time?" Reimu asks Marisa suspiciously, eyeing both of us. At the same time, the other two girls approach me curiously.

"Nothing! I just found em while heading here, seriously." Reimu's expression turns into a curious one.

"While heading here...?" She trails off, thinking about something.

Meanwhile, the other two girls are looking at me curiously.

"Hmm..." The teal-haired girl hums. Seeing her at a close distance like this, I notice her hair looks similar to that of a komainu statue.

...is she an actual komainu herself?

"...uh... hi?" I try greeting her, not really sure where to go with this.

"Ah, I'm sorry for my rudeness!" She realizes what she was doing and promptly apologizes. "My name is Komano Aunn, "
