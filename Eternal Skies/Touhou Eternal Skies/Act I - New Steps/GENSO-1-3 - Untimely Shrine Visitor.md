[POV: Nahoko]

Well, I had initially gauged Marisa to be a curious one, as I've seen during our first encounter, but... man, I completely underestimated that curiosity.

As we made our way to the shrine, I got absolutely bombarded with questions on the way there. I managed to somehow keep up and answer them, up until...

"Say, how'd you even end up *here* in the first place?"

...that question.

I knew exactly how most of it went: Me and Proto escaped our world, we got separated, I went into some sort of "portal" with a... rather daunting amount of eyes, I fell unconscious, and suddenly... here I am. In Gensokyo.

I hesitated a bit on divulging that information, but realized that I don't really have... much to hide. So, I went ahead and... told her.

The situation with my world.

About Proto, who had basically been my partner-in-crime through the entire endeavor.

The escape portal that separated us.

And the thing that brought me here in the first place.

As I told her about almost everything, it felt like a weight was being lifted off my shoulders, but... at the same time, it also felt like I was mentally cracking.

Choosing to not get to that point, I hold back my emotions and continue. 

"*...probably not a good idea at all to do that, since everything can come crashing down on me at once, but... there's a better time to vent. And now is not that time.*"

Marisa noticed my distraught expression as I kept going, but chose to stay silent and let me speak.

...

.....

"And... that's where that ends. Here I am, somehow alive, in Gensokyo."

"..."

Once I finished, she stayed silent, seemingly shocked by my situation.

"Uh... Marisa?" I call out to her, hoping to break the awkward silence from the sudden mood shift.

"Oh, uh... sorry, I just, uh, wasn't expecting the answer to be so... heavy." She frowns. "Though, was that question a bit too... intrusive?" She asks nervously, somewhat worried that she might have poked into something too personal.

"Ah, no. It's fine." I answer, reassuring her. "In fact, being able to speak up like this made me feel a bit less... burdened, if I had to put it." I follow up truthfully.

"Okay, that's good." She sighs. "Well, hey, I'm glad to help ya feel better, even if it wasn't by a lot." Her smile seems to return, though a more gentler one.

"So, the basic gist of it is that... there's 8 kinds of magic where you come from?"

"Correct."

"And those are... Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Electric, Kinetic, Light and Dark magic?"

"Yeah. My specialty is Light magic, but I *am* well-versed in Fire, Kinetic and Air magic too."

...well, I do also have *some* ideas on the other types, but I'd rather focus on what I can *comprehensibly* use.
