...

...

...huh?

Wait a minute, this is solid ground.

"*Did I just fall asleep...?*"

Surely not, right? Then again, I was tired beforehand from escaping almost getting erased, so...

"*...well, that aside, whatever I'm currently faceplanted into is clearly grass...*"

Focusing on my current situation, I push myself off the ground and-

"-oh?"

Gone was the hectic chaos of flying particles from the world beforehand. Now, I'm instead met with a peaceful forest area with occasional chirping, and a stone path to my right.

"*...peaceful...*"

Not being able to help myself, I lay back onto the ground and sigh deeply.

"*...holy shit, it feels like forever since I've felt this serenity.*"

...guess that disaster did a number on me, huh?

"*Hah... well, no point in lamenting about it now. Just hope Proto's doing fine, wherever he could be.*"

...

"*Maybe I could relax here for a bit...*"

Pausing my thoughts, I close my eyes...

...

"Oi!" I hear a female voice call out to someone.

...

"Hellooo? Guy on the grass?" Oh, she's referring to me.

"...me?" I respond, pretending to have not heard the first call.

"I mean, there ain't anyone else here, ze?" ...good point. Also, "ze"?

"Fair enough..."

Raising my body to an upright sitting position, I turn to her direction and am met with a rather curious girl.

I can only describe her attire to be *loosely* maid-like. Black and white color scheme, a black vest and skirt, and a white undershirt and waist apron.

What catches my attention the most is her blonde hair and big-ass witch hat, which also matches the black and white scheme she's following. Oh, and the broom she's holding, for some reason.

"*Those details aside, I sense a hella lot of magic from her...*"

"...are you a magician, perhaps?" I ask curiously.

"Oho?" She grins at my question. "You're half-correct there! I'm both a magician, *and* a witch! You're quite sharp, aren'tcha?"

"Hmm..."

"*Well, magic seems to be common here...*"

...probably could've guessed that a few minutes beforehand from the magic that seems to freely flow around here.

"That aside..." The curious magician stops my thought process. "Who might you be then, ze?"

"*Hmm...*"

On one hand, magic seems to be a common enough thing here to be used, but on the other hand, I have no idea how they deal with outsiders here...

...

...oh, fuck it. Me and Proto jump into situations head-first with no regards for our safety most of the time, so it's probably fine.

"...before that, may I ask where this place is?" I ask.

"Oh? Well, we're both pretty close to Reimu's place right now. The Hakurei Shrine, that is." Oh, a shrine? How curious. And it looks like this "Reimu" is probably the shrine's miko.

"Buuut, if you're curious *where* the shrine is, then this entire place we're in is called Gensokyo!"

...

...yeah, certainly a whole new world.

"...huh. Well... that tells me everything I need to know."

"Any other questions ya need?" The girl asks me.

"No, that's all."

"But, to answer your question a moment ago..."

"*...I've gauged the risks, calculated them, and I have to say... I'm bad at math.*"

I raise my hand up, and point my index finger out. The girl seems to notice this gesture curiously. And with a little bit of thinking-

*poof*

-I make a little ball of light on the tip of my finger, to which she immediately notices, eyes widening in surprise.

"I guess... you could call me an outsider to this 'Gensokyo'. And if you're curious... yes, I'm also a bit of a magician myself, too."

Then, a moment of silence.

...

.....

"...wait, hold on." She starts. "This isn't adding up." ...she's getting more confused. "So you're an *outsider*? That can *use* magic??" Eh?

"...yes? Do your, uh, 'outsiders' not use magic?" I ask carefully.

"More than that! As far as I know, magic *doesn't* exist in the Outside World, like, at all!"

"Oh."

It seems I now understand why she's confused.

"Uh...  would the term 'outsider' be inaccurate for me, then?" I ask.

"Well... not really. You did say you *weren't* from Gensokyo or the Outside World, so another term would be... uh..." She trails off, trying to find the right term.

Not from this world, nor from this 'Outside World', huh...

"...would 'otherworlder' count?" The girl perks up at my response.

"Actually, yeah! That works!" Well, she seems to be content with that.

...

"...so, uh, what now?" I ask, cutting the short silence.

"Hmm? Oh, right! Why don't ya follow me to the shrine, then? I was planning on going there before I spotted you here. Reimu might know what to do with'ja." She suggests.
