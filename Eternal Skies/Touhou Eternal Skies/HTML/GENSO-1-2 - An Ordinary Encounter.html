<h2>
[Somewhere in Gensokyo…]
</h2>
</center>
<center>
<h4>
[POV: Viper]
</h4>
</center>
<p>…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…huh?</p>
<p>Wait a minute, this is solid ground.</p>
<p>“<em>Did I just fall asleep…?</em>”</p>
<p>Surely not, right? Then again, I was tired beforehand from escaping
almost getting erased, so…</p>
<p>“<em>…well, that aside, whatever I’m currently faceplanted into is
clearly grass…</em>”</p>
<p>Focusing on my current situation, I push myself off the ground
and-</p>
<p>“-oh?”</p>
<p>Gone was the hectic chaos of flying particles from the world
beforehand. Now, I’m instead met with a peaceful forest area with
occasional chirping, and a stone path to my right.</p>
<p>“<em>…peaceful…</em>”</p>
<p>Not being able to help myself, I lay back onto the ground and sigh
deeply.</p>
<p>“<em>…holy shit, it feels like forever since I’ve felt this
serenity.</em>”</p>
<p>…guess that disaster did a number on me, huh?</p>
<p>“<em>Hah… well, no point in lamenting about it now. Just hope Proto’s
doing fine, wherever he could be.</em>”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“<em>Maybe I could relax here for a bit…</em>”</p>
<p>Pausing my thoughts, I close my eyes…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Oi!” I hear a female voice call out to someone.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Hellooo? Guy on the grass?” Oh, she’s referring to me.</p>
<p>“…me?” I respond, pretending to have not heard the first call.</p>
<p>“I mean, there ain’t anyone else here, ze?” …good point. Also,
“ze”?</p>
<p>“Fair enough…”</p>
<p>Raising my body to an upright sitting position, I turn to her
direction and am met with a rather curious girl.</p>
<p>I can only describe her attire to be <em>loosely</em> maid-like.
Black and white color scheme, a black vest and skirt, and a white
undershirt and waist apron.</p>
<p>What catches my attention the most is her blonde hair and big-ass
witch hat, which also matches the black and white scheme she’s
following. Oh, and the broom she’s holding, for some reason.</p>
<p>“<em>Those details aside, I sense a hella lot of magic from
her…</em>”</p>
<p>“…are you a magician, perhaps?” I ask curiously.</p>
<p>“Oho?” She grins at my question. “You’re half-correct there! I’m both
a magician, <em>and</em> a witch! You’re quite sharp, aren’tcha?”</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>“<em>Well, magic seems to be common here…</em>”</p>
<p>…probably could’ve guessed that a few minutes beforehand from the
magic that seems to freely flow around here.</p>
<p>“That aside…” The curious magician stops my thought process. “Who
might you be then, ze? An outsider, perhaps?”</p>
<p>Oh? Looks like they deal with outsiders. That could help…</p>
<p>“<em>Hmm…</em>”</p>
<p>On one hand, magic seems to be a common enough thing here to be used,
but on the other hand, I have no idea how they treat any outsiders
here…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…oh, fuck it. Me and Proto jump into situations head-first with no
regards for our safety most of the time, so it’s probably fine.</p>
<p>“…before that, may I ask where this place is?” I ask.</p>
<p>“Oh? Well, we’re both pretty close to Reimu’s place right now. The
Hakurei Shrine, that is.” Oh, a shrine? How curious. And it looks like
this “Reimu” is probably the shrine’s miko.</p>
<p>“Buuut, if you’re curious <em>where</em> the shrine is, then this
entire place we’re in is called Gensokyo!”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…yeah, certainly a whole new world.</p>
<p>“…huh. Well… that tells me everything I need to know.”</p>
<p>“Any other questions ya need?” The girl asks me.</p>
<p>“No, that’s all.”</p>
<p>“But, to answer your question a moment ago…”</p>
<p>“<em>…I’ve gauged the risks, calculated them, and I have to say… I’m
bad at math.</em>”</p>
<p>I raise my hand up, and point my index finger out. The girl seems to
notice this gesture curiously. And with a little bit of thinking-</p>
<p><em>poof</em></p>
<p>-I make a little ball of light on the tip of my finger, to which she
immediately notices, eyes widening in surprise.</p>
<p>“I guess… you could call me an outsider to this ‘Gensokyo’. And if
you’re curious… yes, I’m also a bit of a magician myself, too.”</p>
<p>Then, a moment of silence.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…..</p>
<p>“…wait, hold on.” She starts. “This isn’t adding up.” …she’s getting
more confused. “So you’re an <em>outsider</em>? That can <em>use</em>
magic??” Eh?</p>
<p>“…yes? Do your, uh, ‘outsiders’ not use magic?” I ask carefully.</p>
<p>“More than that! As far as I know, magic <em>doesn’t</em> exist in
the Outside World, like, at all!”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>It seems I now understand why she’s confused.</p>
<p>“Uh… I’m not sure what this ‘Outside World’ is, so… would the term
‘outsider’ be inaccurate for me, then?” I ask.</p>
<p>“Well… not really. You did say you <em>weren’t</em> from Gensokyo or
the Outside World, so another term would be… uh…” She trails off, trying
to find the right term.</p>
<p>Not from this world, nor from this ‘Outside World’, huh…</p>
<p>“…would ‘otherworlder’ count?” The girl perks up at my response.</p>
<p>“Actually, yeah! That works!” Well, she seems to be content with
that.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“…so, uh, what now?” I ask, cutting the short silence.</p>
<p>“Hmm? Oh, right! Why don’t ya follow me to the shrine, then? I was
planning on going there before I spotted you here. Reimu might know what
to do with’ja.” She suggests.</p>
<p>…well, I don’t have anywhere else to go, so…</p>
<p>“Well, why not, I guess. Might need a place to settle down in.” I
take up her suggestion.</p>
<p>“Alright, neat! Though, I do have a couple more questions…” Ever
curious… oh, that reminds me, I haven’t gotten her name yet.</p>
<p>“Ask away.”</p>
<p>“Probably should’ve been the first thing I asked at the start, but…
what’s your name, ze?” Well speak of the devil.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…yeah, guess it’s fine.</p>
<p>“Well… I’m often called by my codename ‘Viper’, but… sure. My real
name is Nahoko. Motomiya Nahoko. Nice to meet you, uh…” I trail off,
letting her pick it up.</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah, mine too, whoops. The name’s Marisa. Kirisame Marisa. Make
sure to remember that! Though… just calling me by the former is fine.
Nice to meet ya!” The blonde girl introduces herself as Kirisame Marisa,
showing a carefree grin and extending her hand out for a handshake.</p>
<p>“<em>…cute.</em>”</p>
<p>…oh, uh, what? Anyways…</p>
<p>I extend my own hand out and return the handshake with a smile.</p>
<p>“<em>Hmm… now that I think about it, she looks pretty… short. And I
don’t mean that as a insult.</em>”</p>
<p>“Say, why don’tja follow me along to the shrine while you answer some
of my questions, ze? Seems better than sittin’ here constantly.” She
suggests.</p>
<p>“Why not, I guess. This place is relaxing, though I’d prefer being in
a living space if possible.”</p>
<p>“Alrighty then! Well, get up from there and follow me!”</p>
<p>“Got it.” Following along, I get up from my unexpected landing spot.
Once I fully got up, I stretched my body for a bit.</p>
<p>Ugh… really feels like forever since I could relax like this.</p>
<p>“Woah! Aren’tcha a tall one!” Marisa exclaims, surprised.</p>
<p>Looking at her again from where my eyes are, then my previous
assumption was very much correct. She is <em>half</em> my height, not
including her witch hat, that is.</p>
<p>“Oh, uhh… thanks.” …at the moment, I can’t exactly tell if I’m tall,
or she’s short. “Well, uh, do we go?”</p>
<p>“Ah, right! C’mon! The shrine’s just ahead.” She signals me, and I
follow along.</p>
<p>…looks like my first encounter with this world went pretty
nicely.</p>
<p>Doesn’t seem like I’ll be going anywhere else beyond this ‘Gensokyo’,
so… might as well see what this land has to offer.</p>
