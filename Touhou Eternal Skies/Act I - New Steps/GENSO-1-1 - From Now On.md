The surroundings decay into particles, consumed by waves of pure entropy.

"...hey."

"Yeah?"

"Do you wish we could've done better for this world?"

"...I do. I really do."

"..."

"Right now, though, we need to go."

"I guess so.

...

You think we'll end up in the same world?"

"...I hope, but, given how this works... probably not."

"Well, hope you're prepared to go solo."

"Heh, fuck you, I'm always prepared.

...you ready?"

"...yeah."

...

And so, they jumped down, falling into the resonating portal.

"...see you on the other side, Viper."

"...same to you, Proto."

[POV: Viper]

As we both fell into the portal, the dissolving world behind us quickly followed, with a violent roar. Closing my eyes, I brace for what's coming next...

...

*SNAP!*

A loud snap.

Then, silence.

Opening my eyes, I'm met with... darkness, as if I never opened them in the first place.

"*...did it not work?*"

Glancing down at my body, it's... fully visible. As it was.

I can see myself, but the surroundings seem to act like an infinite void, absorbing all light.

"...Proto?"

I try calling out to Proto.

No response.

"Damn it."

Unfortunately, Proto was right.

And him being right means we're completely on our own paths now.

...shit.

"*I did say that, but this is gonna take some time to get used to.*"

"*...hopefully he's fine, wherever he got taken to.*"

...now to address the elephant in the room. Or, well, lack thereof:

I'm still in the middle of absolutely god-knows-where.

"*...please tell me I'm not stuck here.*"

...

"Oh?"

Looking around, it's all void. I'm floating in... nothing, but at the distance, I can see something.

"Too far away for me to make something out... hm, can I...?"

Moving my arms and legs, I make a diving motion, and surprisingly enough-

"-it works!"
