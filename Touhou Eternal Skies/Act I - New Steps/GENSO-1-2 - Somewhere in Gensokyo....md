...huh?

Wait a minute, this is solid ground.

"*Did I just fall asleep...?*"

Surely not, right? Then again, I was tired beforehand from escaping almost getting erased, so...

"*...well, that aside, whatever I'm currently faceplanted into is clearly grass...*"

Focusing on my current situation, I push myself off the ground and-

"-oh?"

Gone was the hectic chaos of flying particles from the world beforehand. Now, I'm instead met with a peaceful forest area with occasional chirping, and a stone path to my right.

"*...peaceful...*"

Not being able to help myself, I lay back onto the ground and sigh deeply.

"*...holy shit, it feels like forever since I've felt this serenity.*"

...guess that disaster did a number on me, huh?

"*Hah... well, no point in lamenting about it now. Just hope Proto's doing fine, wherever he could be.*"

"*Maybe I could relax here for a bit...*"

Pausing my thoughts, I close my eyes...

...

"Oi!" I hear a female voice call out to someone.

...

"Hellooo? Guy on the grass?" Oh, she's referring to me.

"...me?" I respond, pretending to have not heard the first call.

"I mean, there ain't anyone else here, ze?" ...good point. Also, "ze"?
